            <h2>Scandals</h2>
            <article>
                <p>The American pop musician Michael Jackson faced allegations of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_accusations_against_Michael_Jackson">child
                        sexual abuse</a> in 1993 and 2003.
                    <br> Additional claims emerged posthumously.
                    In 1993, Evan Chandler, a dentist and screen
                    <br>writer based in Los Angeles, accused Jackson of sexually
                    abusing Chandler's 13-year-old son, <b>Jordan</b>. Jackson had befriended Jordan after renting a
                    vehicle
                    <br>from Jordan's stepfather. Though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD-CV2NsPdA">Evan
                        Chandler</a> initially encouraged the friendship, he later
                    confronted his ex-wife, who had custody of Jordan,
                    <br> with suspicions that the relationship was
                    inappropriate.
