                <p>Michael Joseph Jackson was born in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pnmas5zqqtKnayis6"
                        target="_blank">Gary, Indiana</a>, on August 29, 1958.
                    He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family,
                    <br>
                    a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom
                    house on Jackson Street.
                    <br>
                    His mother, <b>Katherine Esther Jackson</b>, played clarinet and
                    piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer,
                    and worked part-time at Sears.
                    <br>
                    His father, <b>Joseph Walter Jackson</b>, a former boxer,
                    was a crane operator at
                    US Steel
                    <br> and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band,
                    the Falcons, to supplement the family's
                    income.

            <h2>Skin Color</h2>
            <article>
                <p> Michael Jackson was a very proud black man. He loved the natural color of his skin and the only
                    reason that it appeared to turn whitish was because
                    <br> he was trying to cover up two skin diseases that
                    had plagued him since his early twenties: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo"
                        target="_blank"><b>Vitiligo and
                            Lupus</b></a>.
                    <br> Both of these diseases can be
                    disfiguring to the sufferer and are greatly worsened by sunlight and stress.<ins>
                        <br> That is why he always
                        carried an umbrella with him or wore a hat in the sun</ins>.

            <article>
                <p>Michael Jackson attended public grammar school in Gary, Indiana, which he attended in between
                    recording sessions and tours until the age of 11.
                    <br> By the time <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=the+jackson+5"
                        target="_blank"><b>The Jackson 5</b></a> became a nationwide
                    sensation, Michael and his brothers had to leave school.
                    <br> Instead, a private tutor, Rose Fine, whom
                    MJ loved as a second mom, tutored them for 3 hours a day, until Michael Jackson earned his
                    <br>diploma from the <a
