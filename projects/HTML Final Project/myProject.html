            <article>
                <p>All of these tags act the same way like divs but they are written differently and provide more
                    <br>context to our website. Now it is clear that there is a header and footer, that there is
                    something
                    <br>on the side, that there is a navigation menu, and we know where the main part of the page is.
                    <br>This also allows devices for disabled people to know the structure of your website and to know
                    <br> what is important on it.
